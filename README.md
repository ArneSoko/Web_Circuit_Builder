# Web Circuit Builder

The purpose of this project is to create a working web-based circuit planner. I wasn't able to find any as of October 2024.

## Project scope

At the moment (Oct 2024) the scope of my project is only a stripboard circuit planner. 

## Usage

Ensure you have `yarn` or `npm` installed, download the files and run the following command:

### ```yarn start```

## Future plans

As of the current build (Oct 23, 2024) I'm planning the following additions:

    1. Spawn and despawn components
    2. Create different styles of component (resistors, capacitors, etc)
    3. Add a way to cut the stripboard to sever connections
    4. Add integrated circuit chips as components
    5. Customized labeling of components

Currently unplanned but potential additions include:

    1. Changing board type from stripboard to project/perforated board and breadboard
    2. Circuit logic (to test for short-circuits)
    3. PCB designing capability
    4. File exports
